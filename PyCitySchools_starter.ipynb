    "# PyCity Schools Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis, we examined the performance of schools based on various factors such as per student spending, school size, and school type. We utilized data on average math and reading scores, as well as the percentage of students passing math and reading. The analysis aimed to identify trends and correlations between these factors and school performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Impact of Per Student Spending on Performance:\n",
    "Schools with higher per student spending tend to have better performance in both Math and Reading scores. Specifically, schools in the highest spending range ($645-680) showed higher average score than lower spending range.\n",
    "The overall passing percentage also increased with higher spending. This suggests that increased investment in educational resources positively impacts student outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparison Based on School Size:\n",
    "Smaller schools (<1000 students) exhibited higher average reading scores compared to larger schools (2000-5000 students). This may indicate that smaller schools can provide more personalized attention and support to students.\n",
    "However, larger schools had a higher percentage of students passing Math. This could be due to better access to specialized teachers and resources in larger institutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance by School Type:\n",
    "Public charter schools outperformed traditional public schools in both Math and Reading scores. The average Math score for charter schools was significantly higher, thereby indicating a potential benefit of the charter school model.\n",
    "\n",
    "By summarizing and drawing conclusions from the calculations, this report provides insights into how different factors influence school performance. These findings can help educators and policymakers make informed decisions to improve educational outcomes.\n"
